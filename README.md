# Advanced QR Code Secret-Hiding Android Application

## Overview

This repository contains the documentation for an advanced Android application developed during an internship with the Ministry of Electronics & IT (March-May 2024). The application leverages high-payload QR code secret-hiding technology, combining cutting-edge optics and color encoding methods. The system achieves a threefold increase in data storage capacity compared to standard QR codes and introduces multi-distance readability.

By encoding information with secret hash algorithms and advanced color optics, the QR codes generated by this application ensure high security, enhanced data payloads, and resistance to duplication using simple printouts or photographs.

## Features

### 1. High-Payload QR Code Technology
- **Increased Storage Capacity**: Achieves up to three times the data storage of conventional QR codes.
- **Advanced Encoding Mechanism**: Utilizes custom color layers and optics to pack more information into the QR code.

### 2. Multi-Distance Readability
- The QR codes are readable at three distinct distances:
  - **Near**: Suitable for mobile devices held close to the code.
  - **Medium**: Optimized for scanning from desktop monitors or kiosks.
  - **Far**: Designed for long-range scanners or surveillance cameras.

### 3. Secret-Hiding Capability
- **Secret Hashing**: Each QR code encodes a unique secret hash value that acts as a digital fingerprint.
- **Tamper-Proof**: The secret payload cannot be duplicated or reproduced using a simple photo or printout. The QR code must be digitally generated and read by the application.

### 4. Security Mechanisms
- **Optical Validation**: Employs advanced optical techniques to ensure authenticity.
- **Duplication Resistance**: The color encoding and layered optical patterns prevent unauthorized reproduction.

## Technical Details

### High-Payload Encoding
- The application utilizes multi-color optics to encode data across different wavelengths. This creates an effective increase in storage by leveraging:
  - **Red**, **Green**, and **Blue** channels independently.
  - Custom optical patterns that reduce noise and distortion.
- Encodes alphanumeric data, binary data, or both in a compressed format.

### Secret Payload Technology
- **Hash-Based Encoding**:
  - A cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) is generated for each payload.
  - The hash is embedded within the QR code, ensuring the payloadâ€™s integrity.
- **Validation**:
  - During scanning, the application verifies the QR code's hash against the original payload.
  - This prevents unauthorized modifications or reproductions.

### Multi-Distance Readability
- The QR code adapts to viewing distances by using:
  - **Contrast Optimization**: Ensures clear visibility across all layers.
  - **Dynamic Sizing**: Adjusts pixel density and spacing for readability.

### Duplication Resistance
- The system validates the QR code through:
  - **Optical Filters**: Ensuring color fidelity and pattern integrity.
  - **Digital Signature Verification**: Cross-referencing the embedded hash with server-stored records.


## Usage

### Generating a QR Code
1. Launch the application on your Android device.
2. Enter the secret payload and any additional data.
3. The application generates a unique, color-encoded QR code.

### Scanning a QR Code
1. Use the in-app scanner to capture the QR code.
2. The application validates the secret hash.
3. If the hash matches, the payload is decrypted and displayed.

### Security Assurance
- The generated QR code can only be decoded by the original application or authorized readers.
- Attempts to duplicate the QR code using a photo or print will fail due to the embedded optical and hash-based validation mechanisms.

## Applications

- **Secure Document Sharing**: Transmit sensitive information in a tamper-proof format.
- **Authentication Systems**: Use as a second factor in multi-factor authentication.
- **Digital Tickets**: Generate tickets that cannot be counterfeited.
- **IoT and Industry**: Securely encode configuration data for devices.
